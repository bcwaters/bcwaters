## ``` Developer/builder  ```


   - Markdown is underrated at the moment, soon there will be browsable markdown websites to navigate the vast knowledge contained in AI models. Think file sizes < 100kb with all the information needed to generate robust content with a self hosted model on the client side.
   - Currently focused on image processing techniques in TensorFlowJS and TinyGrad.    
   - I believe self-hosted models are the future!
  
### Stuff I'm building at the moment
 React Front-end sample - [MemeSeek](memeseek.com/editor)  Keep the website hush hush until I launch.  
 Command-line OPENAI-api terminal(I use this everyday!) - [ai_cmd](https://github.com/bcwaters/ai_cmd)  
 You can try generating documents with from a prompt with it here: [ai_cmd_doc_builer](https://zingpng.com)  [xterm browser access](https://zingpng.com/xterm)

 ###   Seeking engaging work.
  - An internal tooling team would be amazing.  Specialized functionality with a set of technical users.
  - Any role that gets me closer to working directly with large LLMs
