## Stuff I'm Building
- **Ephemeral email addresses:** [MinusMail](http://www.minusmail.com/) <br/>
    - Code and architecture found in the [repo](https://github.com/bcwaters/minusmail)  

- **Command-line OPENAI-API Terminal:** [ai_cmd](https://github.com/bcwaters/ai_cmd)
  - I use this every day!  
  - Test the terminal in your browser: [xterm browser access](http://minusmail.com/xterm)
 
- **National Fire Incident Graphs:** [repo](https://github.com/bcwaters/fire_project)  [Website](https://www.wildfiregraphs.com)
   - Parsing a pdf containing National Fire Incident data to generate graphs.  This is a work around due to gated apis which cannot be easily accessed.
 
- **Command-line unixtip:** [unixtip](https://github.com/bcwaters/unixtip)
   - I use this sometimes to get command suggestions for CHATGPT in the terminal and execute them.
