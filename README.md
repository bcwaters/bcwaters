# Developer/Builder

- **Markdown is underrated right now.**  
  Soon, we’ll see browsable Markdown websites to navigate the vast knowledge in AI models. Think file sizes < 100KB, packed with all the info needed to generate robust content using a self-hosted model on the client side.  
- **Current Focus:**  
   Implementing AI into my workflows, learning image processing techniques, creating my first transformer models  
- **Big Belief:**  
  Self-hosted models are the future!

## Stuff I'm Building

- **React Front-end Sample:** [MemeSeek](memeseek.com/editor)  
  *Keep the website hush-hush until I launch!*  
- **Command-line OPENAI-API Terminal:** [ai_cmd](https://github.com/bcwaters/ai_cmd)  
  - I use this every day!  
  - Try generating documents from a prompt: [ai_cmd_doc_builder](https://zingpng.com)  
  - Or test the terminal in your browser: [xterm browser access](https://zingpng.com/xterm)  

## Seeking Engaging Work

- **Dream Gig:**  
  An internal tooling team would be amazing—specialized functionality for a set of technical users.  
- **Goal:**  
  Any role that brings me closer to working directly with large LLMs.
