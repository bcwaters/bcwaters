## ```Pre-AI software developer learning to vibe code.  ```


   - Markdown is underrated at the moment, soon there will be browsable markdown websites to navigate the vast knowledge contained in AI models
   - Currently focused on image processing techniques in TensorFlowJS and TinyGrad.    
   - I believe self-hosted models are the future!
  
### Stuff I'm building at the moment
 React Front-end sample - [MemeSeek](memeseek.com/editor)  the backend is still brittle, so keep the website hush hush.
 Command-line OPENAI-api terminal(I use this everyday!) - [grok_cmd](https://github.com/bcwaters/grok_cmd)
